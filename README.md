## Project Motivation
After the Stoneman Douglass Shooting, I became very angry with the current gun control policy and the unsatisfactory preventative response to school shootings. At the time, I was young and inexperienced - but, I had an idea. Virtual Reality technology could be used to better prepare high school students for potential school shootings. This idea ripened in my head until-at the beginning of this year-I had a conversation with a peer about creating Virtual Reality Simulations using game engines and the programming language C#. Suddenly, my idea from years ago culminated - all pieces of its puzzle aligned together. All that was left to do was put my newfound plan into action.
