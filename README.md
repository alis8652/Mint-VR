# Mint VR
## The Start
After the Stoneman Douglass Shooting, I became very angry with the current gun control policy and the unsatisfactory preventative response to school shootings. I was young and inexperienced at the time - but I had an idea. Virtual Reality technology could better prepare high school students for potential school shootings. This idea ripened in my head until-at the beginning of this year-I had a conversation with a peer about creating Virtual Reality Simulations using game engines and the programming language C#. Suddenly, my idea from years ago culminated - all the pieces of its puzzle aligned together. All that was left to do was put my newfound plan into action.
## Project Motivation
The current state mandates in regard to training students on how to handle school shootings to optimize their probability of survival are minimal. In most states, training seminars are given by the police to students who likely will not retain the information being fed to them. Furthermore, students do not receive disarmament/self-defense training which would help them if they encountered a shooter. It would be best if local police departments could give every high schooler this type of training; however, this plan of action would stretch community resources thin. This is where Mint VR comes in. 
## Project Description
Mint VR is the name I have given to the project I started over the past few months. Using the game engine Unity and introducing myself to a new coding language (C#), I was able to create and render a VR animation that firstly simulates the environment of a school shooting, secondly, teaches correct disarmament form and technique, and thirdly, uses primitive hand tracking technology to physically prompt the user to practice disarming a shooter in a virtual environment. I hope this project proves to be a cheap and efficient way to train students to deal with the threat of school shootings looming above their heads. 
## Problems/Innovative Roadblocks
This next section is meant to enumerate the roadblocks I have encountered due to a need for more resources. Tips/suggestions would be appreciated. Firstly, the graphics I used to create the game were relatively low quality, and I did not know how to get my hands on high-quality animations for cheap. Secondly, I would have liked the user to be prompted by some sound system - however, I could not find such a system for cheap. Thirdly, the current hand tracking hardware I have created is, at best, functional, at worst unsophisticated. How do I make a sophisticated hand-tracking software for cheap?
